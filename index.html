        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Train Conductor</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I like learning and working with many different things. Being hands on is something that I strive for. Working towards a new goal every year, and hoping to open new doors and break down old ones. I am a visual learner but I learn quickly and work hard everyday to exceed expectations. I am bilingual, so I can communicate in both English and Spanish which can be very helpful to provide better service for a larger number of people. I like working together as a team, as it makes me more comfortable to get objectives done. I am very friendly and have the ability to work well with most people. I feel like I have a good ability to keep calm in high stress situations, I can always find a way to relax and refocus on the task at hand. I can also provide a more fun work environment due to my enthusiasm and charming personality. I feel like I can provide a good quality of work and discipline that can rub off on others. <br><br>

        I hope to be able to work with trains one day as I have always been fascinated by them. In many countries not named the United States, public transportation is still preferred over cars, in highly populated areas such as cities. I hope to one day be able to ride on the Shinkansen in Japan, due to it being called the bullet train. One of the fastest trains in the world that can get to places quicker. I also hope to one day see a world where we have more trains in the United States that can go at even greater speeds and help people arrive to destinations quicker than cars can. I also hope that the cost of travelling gets cheap so that anyone can get a ride regardless of how much money they have in their pocket. Trains have evolved much since the industrial revolution to the point that many don’t have to be reliant on burning coal and generating steam for it to be powered. Many trains are electric and provide a zero emissions way of transportation<br><br>

        Goal in life is to help others, to be able to provide many people with better opportunities. I want to be able to help communities that are under-resourced and under funded so that we can give more people a brighter future. I also want to help pet shelters so that pets that live on the streets can be taken in and possibly prevent unnecessary euthanization of dogs and cats. I also want to be able to raise more awareness for wildfires that can happen in the future, along with raising awareness for pollution. I also hope to one day publish a webcomic, and build on my creativity. I want to learn how to swim, drive a manual car, and how to ride a bike. I would also like to learn how vinyl records work and how that eventually evolved into CD’s. Let's create a better world.
